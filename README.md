# CSE306_Project2

This is the repository for the second assignment of CSE306: Computer Graphics course. The current commit will generate the frames of fluid simulation with 50 particles for testing purpose.

For more information, please refer to the [Report](CSE306_AS2_report.pdf). There is also a fluid simulation video with 200 particles (requires so long to generate). Please refer to the [video](fluid_animation.mp4)
